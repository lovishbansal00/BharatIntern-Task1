# Video Conferencing Tool - Task 1

Welcome to the repository of a video conferencing tool developed as a full-stack project using EJS. This project was completed as part of my internship at Bharat Intern, where I worked as a Full Stack Developer. The video conferencing tool enables users to communicate through video and audio in real-time, making it convenient for remote collaboration and virtual meetings.

## Features

- **Video Conferencing**: Users can initiate video conferences with multiple participants, allowing them to see and hear each other in real-time.
- **Audio Conferencing**: Participants can join conferences using audio-only mode if they prefer not to use video.
- **Screen Sharing**: Users have the option to share their screens, enabling effective presentations, demonstrations, and collaboration.
- **Chat Functionality**: Participants can communicate through text-based chat during video conferences, facilitating instant messaging and information sharing.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- EJS (Embedded JavaScript) - Templating engine for dynamic rendering of content.
- Node.js - JavaScript runtime environment.
- Express - Web application framework for building the server-side components.
- Socket.IO - Real-time communication library for enabling video and audio conferencing.
- HTML - Markup language for creating the structure and content of the web pages.
- CSS - Stylesheet language for designing the visual presentation and layout.
- JavaScript - Programming language for implementing interactivity and functionality.
- MongoDB - NoSQL database for storing user information and conference details.
